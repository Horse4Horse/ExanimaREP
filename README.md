# Exanima Reverse Engineering Project
This is a repository for the project of the IDA 64, version **7.7** with the hex-rays decompiler (x64) v7.6.
Game version is **0.9.1.6**, it is mine **LTS** version.
Manifest ID is **5340348285682058102** (download_depot 362490 362491 5340348285682058102)

## Updating for newer version of the game
You can update this project file to the any of the latest x64 versions.
It can be done less painful with **Diaphora** plugin for IDA.
**Diaphora** won't transfer defined structures, VMT's or any of the defined data in disassembly window, but at least it will partially help with the function namings and types, as well as with the pseudocode diffing. Somehow it manages to define more functions than **BinDiff**.

## Support
Do not send your upgrades in the form of IDA project files. IDA can sometimes break something, especially with the help of auto-loading plugins, and I don't have that much time to verify everything on each occasion.

# Disclaimer
I'm trying my best to make sure that all defines, structures and naming are correct, but with a sheer amount of possibilities of misrepresentation data I can make mistakes and name/define something wrong. So I'll be glad if you point out to me the errors.

**This project is for educational purposes only. We want to add fun to the game, not to steal someone's code.**
